# Introduction

we will talk about Capacitors (C) and Inductors (L).

- these equations involve either integration of differentiation
- circuits that contain capacitors and/or inductors are able to store energy
- capacitor voltages and inductor currents are continuous functions of time
- series of parallel capacitors/inductors can be reduced to an equivalent capacitor/inductor

# The impact of time

we have assumed that everything happens instantaneously. Now, input-output relationships have a dependence on time.

- these elements can "store" energy

# Energy Storage Elements

- **Capacitors** store energy in an electric field
- **Inductors** store energy in a magnetic field
- capacitors and inductors are passive elements
  - can store energy supplied by a circuit
  - can return energy to a circuit
  - cannot supply more energy to a circuit than the energy stored
